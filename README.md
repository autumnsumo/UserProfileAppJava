User Profile App (Java)
Overview
This is an Android app developed for the Profile Activity assignment as part of my application for the Android App Development internship. The app is implemented in Java and features a user profile UI with sections for personal information, rewards & benefits, and transactions & support. The UI matches the provided design specifications, and the app includes custom icons to enhance the visual appeal.
Features

Profile Section: Displays user information such as name, phone number, and email.
Rewards & Benefits: Shows cashback balance, coins, and a refer & earn option with custom icons.
Transactions & Support: Provides access to transaction history with a custom icon.
Dark Theme: Uses a dark background (#121212) with white text and icons for a modern look.
Icon Credits: Includes an "About" screen with credits for the icons used (optional feature).
